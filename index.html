        <h1>Hi, I'm Aya!</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! This is Aya, welcome to my site.  I am a Japanese girl from 
            Fukuoka Japan.  I am an accountant, and I live in Tokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
            My First job out of college was working at Deloitte.  I worked there
            for 7 years, I was an auditor.  I worked initially in Tokyo, 
            for the first 4 years, and then I had the opportunity to go
            to the United States for 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was in the US. I met the love of my life, Mark, he is a cool
            guy.  We met at the air show in San Franciso.  It was a really fun time!
            For our first date he took me on a trip to Sequoia National park in his 
            silver Lexus. Fancy ne!
        </p>
        <p>
            After working at Deloitte I had a short time period where I worked at 
            Thermo Fisher, it's a biomedical company that does gene sequencing. 
            I think they are doing great things for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I am am working as an accountant at mercari, you may have seen some of the
            ads on TV.  They are really popular in Japan, and I love selling my excess things on 
            there, and am now able to make a profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I live away from my husband Mark in Japan, but I hope that one day,
            soon our visa will be approved, and I will be able to move to the United States
            to go live with him.  It's been too long, and I'm very sad that I'm unable to spend
            time with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this winter, I was able to visit him in Hawaii, and it was a great trip.  there
            was a rainbow every day!
