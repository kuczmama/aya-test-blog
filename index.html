                <h1>Hi, I'm Aya!</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello! This is Aya, welcome to my site.  I am a Japanese girl from 
                    Fukuoka Japan.  I am an accountant, and I live in Tokyo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My First job out of college was working at Deloitte.  I worked there
                    for 7 years, I was an auditor.  I worked initially in Tokyo, 
                    for the first 4 years, and then I had the opportunity to go
                    to the United States for 2 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was in the US. I met the love of my life, Mark, he is a cool
                    guy.  We met at the air show in San Franciso.  It was a really fun time!
                    For our first date he took me on a trip to Sequoia National park in his 
                    silver Lexus. Fancy ne!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After working at Deloitte I had a short time period where I worked at 
                    Thermo Fisher, it's a biomedical company that does gene sequencing. 
                    I think they are doing great things for the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am am working as an accountant at mercari, you may have seen some of the
                    ads on TV.  They are really popular in Japan, and I love selling my excess things on 
                    there, and am now able to make a profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I live away from my husband Mark in Japan, but I hope that one day,
                    soon our visa will be approved, and I will be able to move to the United States
                    to go live with him.  It's been too long, and I'm very sad that I'm unable to spend
                    time with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this winter, I was able to visit him in Hawaii, and it was a great trip.  there
                    was a rainbow every day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for reading my blog!  Feel free to ask me any question!!!
