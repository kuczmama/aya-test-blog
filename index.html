    <h1>I'm Aya</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! This is Aya, welcome to my site.  I am a Japanese girl from 
        Fukuoka Japan.  I am an accountant, and I live in Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p>
        My First job out of college was working at Deloitte.  I worked there
        for 7 years, I was an auditor.  I worked initially in Tokyo, 
        for the first 4 years, and then I had the opportunity to go
        to the United States for 2 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in the US. I met the love of my life, Mark, he is a cool
        guy.  We met at the air show in San Franciso.  It was a really fun time!
        For our first date he took me on a trip to Sequoia National park in his 
        silver Lexus. Fancy ne!
    </p>
    <p>
        After working at Deloitte I had a short time period where I worked at 
        Thermo Fisher, it's a biomedical company that does gene sequencing. 
        I think they are doing great things for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I am am working as an accountant at mercari, you may have seen some of the
        ads on TV.  They are really popular in Japan, and I love selling my excess things on 
        there, and am now able to make a profit.
